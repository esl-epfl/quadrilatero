`quadrilatero` is a Systolic Array based on a custom set extensions available [here](https://github.com/esl-epfl/xheep_matrix_spec)
 dervided from a subset of the RISC-V `RVM` ISA extensions proposed by T-HEAD Matrix. 
It has been developed at the Embedded System Laboratory (ESL) at EPFL.
It uses the CORE-V-X-IF interface to interface with the `OpenHW Group` CPUs.

An `LLVM` extended with the proposed instructions is available [here](https://github.com/epfl-systemf/rvm-compiler-project)
